BlockingMap is a thread-safe data structure designed to simplify the processing of asynchronous API responses. It acts like a map with added support for blocking retrieval, timeouts, and event notifications. Ideal for scenarios where multiple threads interact with a shared pool of API results. Lightweight, easy to integrate, and built on top of Java's ConcurrentHashMap and CompletableFuture.
